34.
1. Label first vertex e.g. L(A) = 0
2. Note lengths to neighbor vertexes e.g.
    L(B) = 3
    L(C) = 5
    L(D) = 4
3. Label vertex with the smallest length (in this case L(B))
    If this vertex is already noted, but with greater distance -- cross it out
4. Repeat step 2, but do not check vertexes that are already labeled.
5. If you label last vertex (in this case L(Z)), then length assigned to it is the shortest path.
